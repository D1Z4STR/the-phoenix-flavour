### The Team

- **Lively** created and maintains the Wabbajack installer for TPF, and puts up with all the related help requests.

### Past and present contributors

- Madi
- alsa
- Slim

### The Website

- **Step** for setting up Hugo and the Docsy theme, and for putting up with my constant pestering and feature requests as well as the dark theme (you know it's for you).
- **Kai** for implementing the theme toggle so that alsa and I can use light mode, yay!
- **vaecors** for reminding me that Hugo would work perfectly with the markdown version of the guide and supporting us in setting it up.
- **erri120** without whom I might never have tried Github which turned out to be the perfect solution.

### Further Acknowledgements

- Thanks to **Lexy** whose guide inspired me in many ways and with whom I've enjoyed some great conversations about the woes of maintaining a modding guide.
- Thanks to **halgari** and the Wabbajack team with whom we've been in touch since its inception and who have been very accomodating and supportive.
- And lastly, thanks to many mod authors and fellow guide authors who have contributed to
